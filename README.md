```text
docx,pdf
```
- Code (Under development)
```text
c, cpp, h, hpp, py, java, mat, m, cs, asm, js, v, vhd, vhdl, r
```

```

## File structure
```text

├── common.py
├── config.py
├── main.py
tools/
├── compare/
│   ├── code.py
│   ├── image.py
│   ├── text.py
├── extract/

requirements.txt
```

## How to use
1. (Optional) Create a virtual environment.
```bash
python -m venv VIRTUAL_ENV_NAME
source VIRTUAL_ENV_NAME/bin/activate
```

2. Install the required packages.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Place the files you want to compare (ex. source code, document, text) in the `submission` directory.
```text
submission/
├── studentname/
│   ├── code1.cpp
│   ├── code2.cpp
│   ├── report.docx
│   ├── report.pdf
├── couldbeanyname/
│   ├── code1.cpp
│   ├── code2.java
│   ├── code3.py
│   ├── report.pdf
```

4. (Optional) If you have assignments that previously submitted by students, place them in the `reference` directory.
```text
reference/
├── prev_studentname/
│   ├── code1.cpp
│   ├── code2.cpp
│   ├── report.docx
│   ├── report.pdf
├── prev_studentname2/
│   ├── code1.cpp
│   ├── code2.java
│   ├── code3.py
│   ├── report.pdf
```
5. Run the program.
```bash
python src/main.py
```

6. The results will be saved in the `result` directory.
```text
result/
├── result.csv
```
